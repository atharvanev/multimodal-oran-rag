# Multimodal-Oran-RAG

## Project Status

üöß **Work in Progress** ‚Äî This project is under active development. Many features are planned and not yet fully implemented. Current focus areas include preprocessing O-RAN documents and prototyping multimodal retrieval pipelines.

## Project Description

**multimodal-oran-rag** is a research **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** designed for **O-RAN (Open Radio Access Network) technical documents**. The pipeline enables extraction, indexing, and retrieval of both **textual and visual content** from complex O-RAN specifications, making these highly technical materials more accessible for researchers, students, and telecom engineers.

### Features (Planned & In Progress)

- **Document Preprocessing**: Parses O-RAN technical PDFs into structured text segments and image-based content.  
- **Multimodal Embeddings**: Supports retrieval across text, diagrams, and visual elements using unified or modality-specific embeddings.  
- **Retrieval Pipelines**: Implements and compares multiple approaches, including:  
  - Unified Embedding Retrieval  
  - Cross-Modality Grounding  
  - Modality-Specific Retrieval  
- **Integration with LLMs**: Provides context-aware generation, summarization, and Q&A on O-RAN documentation.  
- **Evaluation Framework**: Includes methodology for testing **accuracy, latency, and relevance** across retrieval strategies.

### Use Cases

- Automated **technical Q&A** for O-RAN standards and 5G documentation.  
- **Diagram captioning** and visual interpretation for enhanced understanding.  
- Construction of a **knowledge base** for telecom researchers and engineers.  
- Improving **document accessibility** for education, training, and research in wireless networks.
